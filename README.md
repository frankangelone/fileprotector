File Protector
=============

Mission: To Send / Receive Files To / From A Password Protected Shared Folder.

Development Stack (Currently runs on):

PHP 5.3.6, Apache HTTP Server 2.2.21, MySQL 5.5.9, phpMyAdmin 3.3.9.2

Suggestions:  Use MAMP, WAMP, or XAMP to get up and running.  

About:  This program was originally developed while I was in grad school with the intention of helping users at Universities download and upload files to a shared folder while their access rights were temporarily lost.  The plan to open source this project is to see if the community can assist in expanding the idea and make this utility something even more useful than my original plans. Losing access to a shared folder can be extremely frustrating for users and the amount of time it takes to restore that access can vary on a number of circumstances. File Protector gives them back that access so they continue uploading and downloading the files they need until their access has been restored.
